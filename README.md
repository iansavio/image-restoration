# image-restoration
A project to restore images with fixed pattern of missing pixels for the final report of the Advanced Topic in Knowledge-based Systems course, Spring semester of 2023 by Ignasius Ian Savio Gunawan 6613230003-9.

A folder in the repository consists of the images used in this project. The dataset is comprised of grayscale bitmap image files from the class as well as the JPEG image files fomr ImageNet. Due to time and resources constraint, only a total of 1500 images were used. In the future, more images can be used to expand the dataset and improve the performance of the models.

The organized dataset has been saved in npy files named according to their corresponding model. The trained models have also been saved. These models can be loaded using numpy's load function.
